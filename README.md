# De0-Nano-SoC-CGI
This is a simple. The main purpose is to check the activities of HPS core on the Nano-SoC De0 kit.
In this example, I write a CGI script for the HPS core (with C programming language). I will control 
LED HPS through a simple website. Remember to enable the lighttpd's CGI module in Kit's OS and do 
not forget install Altera SoC-EDS.
